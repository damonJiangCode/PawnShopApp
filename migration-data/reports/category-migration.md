# Item Category Mapping

## Decision

The new system stays simple:

```txt
item_category
item_subcategory
```

Do not copy the old system's full category tree.

Migration should map from the most specific legacy value first:

```txt
WC520SUBCAT.WC520DESC -> new item_category / item_subcategory
```

Only when the legacy bottom-level subcategory is not meaningful, such as `--- Other ---`, blank, or unknown, fall back to the legacy parent category:

```txt
WC510CATEGORY.WC510DESCRIPTION -> new item_category / item_subcategory
```

## Added Target Subcategories

These subcategories were added to the app seed and migration database:

```txt
APPAREL / jacket
APPAREL / sunglasses
APPAREL / belt
APPAREL / handcuffs
APPAREL / hat

```

## Mapping Priority

Apply rules in this order:

```txt
1. Normalize legacy subcategory text.
2. If subcategory is specific, map by subcategory rule.
3. If subcategory is other/blank/unknown, map by legacy parent category.
4. If no rule matches, map to the parent category's `other`.
5. If no parent category is usable, map to OTHER / other.
```

Normalize text by trimming, lowercasing, and ignoring punctuation/case where needed.
