## Employees: EM200EMPLOYEE -> employee

Source rows: 101
Existing target employees: 102
Would insert by employee id: 0
Missing password: 0
Missing birthdate: 2
Missing nickname: 0

Would insert employee ids sample:
_none_

Employee migration needs a default strategy for required app fields: date_of_birth, gender, nickname, and password.


## Current Decision Status

- ID type and hair/eye color mapping is approved in `reports/static-migration.md`.
- Location mapping is approved in `reports/location-migration.md`; unresolved legacy locations map to `UNKNOWN`.
- Item category simplification is approved in `reports/category-migration.md`.
- Employee migration is still pending; password/nickname/default DOB rules are not finalized.
