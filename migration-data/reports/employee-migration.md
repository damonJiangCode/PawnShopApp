## Summary

| Metric                 | Count |
| ---------------------- | ----: |
| Legacy employee rows   |   101 |
| Employees prepared     |   102 |
| Terminated employees   |    16 |
| Managers               |     1 |

## Rules

- Add placeholder employee `999 / Legacy Employee` for legacy tickets that used employee number 999.
- Set `gender` to `unknown` because the legacy employee table has no gender column.
- Set missing or invalid birth dates to `1900-01-01`.
- Map `EM200Terminated = 1` to `is_terminated = true`; terminated employee passwords cannot authorize app actions.
- Set employee `69 / WEI FENG` as manager.
- No employee photo field is migrated because `EM200PICTURE` has no usable photo rows.
- After commit, ticket `employee_name` placeholders are backfilled from migrated employee nicknames.
